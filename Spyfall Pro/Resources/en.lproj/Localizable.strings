Responses can take any form. The player who answers the question proceeds to ask any other player a question of their own, but cannot ask a question of the player who just asked them a question. The order in which the questions are asked is established by the players themselves and based on the suspicions they have after hearing the questions and answers.";

"endOfRoundText" = "A round ends when one of the following three things happen.\n\n1. The timer ended: When time runs out, each player gets to accuse another player of being the spy. Players are now free to discuss their suspicions. If the players unanimously, except the suspect, vote for the suspect, they win (provided that the suspect is the Spy). A second or third ballot is not allowed. In any other case, the Spy wins.\n\n2. When a Player Gets Suspicious: Each player can stop the game (along with the timer) at any time, but only once in each round. He then selects one player as a suspect and asks the other players to vote. The accused does not take part in the voting. If the vote is unanimous, the round ends (regardless of whether the suspect is the Spy). If the Spy is found in this way, the player who asked for a vote wins 1 victory point. Even the Spy can take advantage of accusing another player in order to mislead the rest. If there is no unanimous vote, the round with time continues normally from the point where it was interrupted. Do not discuss during the voting (eg I think this player is the Spy, because he said his clothes are green and he should be blue). \"For\" and \"against\" arguments can inadvertently betray the site.\n\n3. At the Spy’s Request: The Spy can stop the round and the timer at any time, revealing his card. If he guesses the location correctly, he wins. Otherwise, the other players win. The Spy cannot guess the location during another player voting. He missed his chance. If they vote for him, then he loses for this round.";

However, when a player asks and answers too vaguely, players may begin to suspect him, allowing the real Spy to win.\n\nThe Spy's goal is to listen carefully to what the players are saying, not to reveal themselves and to guess correctly the location of the players before time runs out. It is dangerous for the Spy to wait for the round to end, because it is very likely that the other players will reveal him in the final vote.";

Players are scored according to the result of each round.";
